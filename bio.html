            <p>Born on April 3rd, 2000, I am a millennium Aries baby, if that’s a thing. I grew an only child on the north side
                of Charlotte,
                <abbr title="North Carolina">N.C.</abbr> in an area called Hornets Nest Park and have been living here ever since. Growing up with a passion
                for technology and building things, you would always catch me with a phone or a handheld video game, maybe
                even taking apart someones else’s phone from time to time. I’ve literally had my career path set on technology
                since I was about nine years old and always knew that one day I would be working with it, doing something
                I love! I attended Phillip O. Berry Academy of Technology where I participated in the Engineering Academy
                and received my
                <abbr title="National Academy Foundation">NAF</abbr> diploma along with my actual high school diploma. I have yet to go to college because I am currently
                participating in the Road to Hire program at Red Ventures and I am training to become a Web Developer soon.
                Some of my hobbies include playing video games, watching YouTube videos, and watching and spectating on football
                and basketball games. </p>
        </section>
        <section title="Why Technology?">
            <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned before, my passion for technology started when I was young. I didn’t have much of it coming up
                but as I got older and realized the great impact it had on our world and our society it kinda just grew on
                me. From education to health science, technology plays a big part in our lives and the endless creativity
                it brings out makes it
                <abbr title="ten-times">10x</abbr> more fun! Technology has taken a big leap since I was younger and I would love to learn as much
                as I can about it so I can then help the newer generations out by making their lives much easier, organized
                and safer. Honestly without technology I don’t know where I would be in my journey today…</p>
